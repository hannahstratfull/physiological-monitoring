# physiological-monitoring

The primary aim of this project is to design an innovative device for the purpose of measuring physiological stress responses in humans. This is device is a wearable vest with modular physiological sensors that will allow for novel research in listening.
CAD and code for each of our sensor modules is located in their respective folders. The sensors we have designed are: an ECG module, an EMG module, an audio module, a breathing rate sensor (dubbed FlexiForce), and an IMU module. There are also designs for a handheld controller device and a PC dongle allowing for PC connectivity, as well as generic code that will allow you to design your own module should you wish.
